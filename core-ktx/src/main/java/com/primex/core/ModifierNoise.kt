/**
 * A Style Modifier that applies a noise effect to the content using a Shader.
 *
 * This modifier draws a tiled noise pattern on top of the content, creating a visually textured overlay.
 * It can be combined with other modifiers to achieve various effects, like:
 *
 * - Simulating iOS-style blur effects by combining it with blur and background modifiers.
 * - Adding subtle texture to backgrounds or images for a more organic look.
 * - Creating unique visual styles and emphasizing depth in UI elements.
 *
 * @param alpha: The opacity of the noise effect, ranging from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque).
 * @constructor Creates a NoiseModifier with the specified alpha value.
