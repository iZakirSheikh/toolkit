/**
 * A value class representing a squircle shape.
 *
 * A squircle is a mathematical shape that combines aspects of a square and a circle.
 * This implementation uses BÃ©zier curves to create a smooth, rounded shape with adjustable curvature.
 *
 * @param radius The radius of the corners, as a fraction of the minimum dimension of the shape.
 * Should be a value between 0.0 (square) and 1.0 (approaches a circle).
